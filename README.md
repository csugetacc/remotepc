If you want to run this program you will need to create a 'hosts.csv' file containing the server device's IP. 
the program will work using public IP if you allow port forwarding on 5000 & 5001 or you can use the local IP for LAN conections.
hosts.csv should be formatted like:

mypc, 10.0.0.20
mysecondpc, 10.0.0.21
